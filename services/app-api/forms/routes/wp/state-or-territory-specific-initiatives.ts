            "A state or territory-specific initiative is a plan or process designed to improve MFP Demonstration program performance and advance MFP statutory goals, which include increasing the use of home and community-based services (HCBS) over institutional long-term services and supports (LTSS), removing barriers that prevent individuals from receiving support in their preferred settings, improving the quality of life for MFP participants, and ensuring continued access to HCBS and quality assurance. Each initiative includes a defined set of activities designed to address gaps, challenges, or opportunities in state or territory MFP programs and is associated with an MFP grant funding source. Initiatives can be funded using one or more of these funding sources:<br>",

## Configuration - AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SSM)

The following values are used to configure the deployment of this service (see below for more background and context).
| Parameter | Required? | Accepts a default? | Accepts a branch override? | Purpose |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| .../iam/path | N | Y | Y | Specifies the [IAM Path](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names) at which all IAM objects should be created. The default value is "/". The path variable in IAM is used for grouping related users and groups in a unique namespace, usually for organizational purposes.|
| .../iam/permissionsBoundaryPolicy | N | Y | Y | Specifies the [IAM Permissions Boundary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) that should be attached to all IAM objects. A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. If set, this parmeter should contain the full ARN to the policy.|
| .../sechub/githubAccessToken | Y | Y | Y | This is a personal access token of a GitHub user, and is required. The token's owner must have push privileges to the repository. If you're adding issues to an Org Project board (using githubOrganizationProjects as specified below), the token's owner must have permissions to modify Org level Project boards. The token creation process has good detail on which permissions grant what access, and should be straightforward.|
| .../sechub/githubRepository | N | Y | Y | Not required, and very unlikely to be used. By default, the github repository for which issues will be modified is set to this service's repo. In other words, this service and lambda will modify issues in the repo that built it. This parameter exists in the event a user wants to push issues to a different repository. Please don't bother with this parameter unless you're sure its something you want, because you don't need it; if you're confused by this explanation, forget it, because you don't need this.|
| .../sechub/githubRepositoryProjects | N | Y | Y | Not required, but recomended. This holds the names of repo owned GitHub Projects to which you'd like to add your GitHub Issues. The parameter is a comma-delimited string containing one or more Project names. If a value is not specified, the service will still create and manage Issues in the target repository... the issues just won't be added to any Project boards.|
| .../sechub/githubOrganizationProjects | N | Y | Y | Not required, but recomended. This holds the names of organization owned GitHub Projects to which you'd like to add your GitHub Issues. This functions exactly like githubRepositoryProjects (above), but is for Organization level Project boards. This can be useful if, for instance, you'd like 'n' number of projects to create issues, add them to their project board, but then also add them to an Org-wide board; this would give insight into the security hub findings for all participants in the organization.|
| .../sechub/severity | N | Y | Y | Not required. This defines the Security Hub Finding severity level(s) for which you'd like to create Issues. This is a comma-delimited string containing one or more labels. By default, this is set to collect CRITICAL and HIGH severity findings.|

This project uses [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), often referred to as simply SSM, to inject environment specific, project specific, and/or sensitive information into the deployment.
In short, SSM is an AWS service that allows users to store (optionally) encrypted strings in a directory like hierarchy. For example, "/my/first/ssm/param" is a valid path for a parameter. Access to this service and even individual paramters is granted via AWS IAM.

An example of environment specific information is the id of a VPC into which we want to deploy. This VPC id should not be checked in to git, as it may vary from environment to environment, so we would use SSM to store the id information and use the [Serverless Framework's SSM lookup capability](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables/#reference-variables-using-the-ssm-parameter-store) to fetcn the information at deploy time.

This project has also implemented a pattern for specifying defaults for variables, while allowing for branch (environment specific overrides). That pattern looks like this:

```
sesSourceEmailAddress: ${ssm:/configuration/${self:custom.stage}/sesSourceEmailAddress~true, ssm:/configuration/default/sesSourceEmailAddress~true}
```

The above syntax says "look for an ssm parameter at /configuration/<branch name>/sesSourceEmailAddress; if there isn't one, look for a parameter at /configuration/default/sesSourceEmailAddress". With this logic, we can specify a generic value for this variable that would apply to all environments deployed to a given account, but if we wish to set a different value for a specific environment (branch), we can create a parameter at the branch specific path and it will take precedence.

In the above tabular documentation, you will see columns for "Accepts default?" and "Accepts a branch override?". These columns relate to the above convention of searching for a branch specific override but falling back to a default parameter. It's important to note if a parameter can accept a default or can accept an override, because not all can do both. For example, a parameter used to specify Okta App information cannot be set as a default, because Okta can only support one environment (branch) at a time; so, okta_metadata_url is a good example of a parameter that can only be specified on a branch by branch basis, and never as a default.

In the above documentation, you will also see the Parameter value denoted as ".../iam/path", for example. This notation is meant to represent the core of the parameter's expected path. The "..." prefix is meant to be a placeholder for either "/configuration/default" (in the case of a default value) or "/configuration/myfavoritebranch" (in the case of specifying a branch specific override for the myfavoritebranch branch.
